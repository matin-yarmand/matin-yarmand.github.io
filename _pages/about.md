I'm an Assistant Professor of Software and Information Systems at UNC Charlotte. My research lies at the intersection of **Human-Computer Interaction**, **Educational Technology**, and **Applied AI**. I am a member of the [<u>Human-Centered Computing (HCC) Lab</u>](https://sites.google.com/uncc.edu/hci-cci/home), [<u>Center for Education Innovation and Research (CEIR)</u>](https://sites.google.com/view/cci-center-for-education-innov/home), and [<u>Center for Humane AI Studies (CHAIS)</u>](https://sites.google.com/uncc.edu/center-for-humane-ai/home).

I received my PhD in Computer Science and Engineering from UC San Diego, working with [<u>Nadir Weibel</u>](https://hxi.ucsd.edu/author/nadir-weibel/) in the [<u>Design Lab</u>](https://designlab.ucsd.edu/). I hold a bachelor's degree in Computer Science from University of British Columbia and was a member of [<u>Designing for People (DfP)</u>](https://dfp.ubc.ca/)

<!-- <h5>Research Themes</h5> -->
In todayâ€™s rapidly evolving labor market, workers must continuously re-skill to keep pace with new demands. My research draws inspiration from human coaching practices to design AI-driven, task-embedded, and attention-cueing learning systems that help people acquire these emerging skills. I especially focus on addressing training needs for complex and ill-defined domains beyond formal education, such as healthcare residency training and  fleet driver development.

I welcome 2 PhD students for Fall 2026, and sponsor undergraduate students via independent study/capstone courses!</span>
