Inspired by the dialogic model of abstract metaphors, as well as the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to produce on-demand support, we investigate the use of metaphors to facilitate engagement between Science and Technology Studies (STS) and System HCI. Our reflective-style survey with early-career HCI researchers (N=48) reported that limited prior exposure to STS research can hinder perceived openness of the work, and ultimately interest in reading. The survey also revealed that metaphors enhance likelihood to continue reading STS papers, and alternative perspectives can build critical thinking skills to mitigate potential risks of LLM-generated metaphors. We lastly offer a specified model of metaphor exchange (within this generative context) that incorporates alternative perspectives to construct shared understanding in interdisciplinary engagement.</p> </div> <div class="bib hidden"> <pre style="font-size: 0.85em;"><code>@article{yarmand2025towards,

The sudden shift to online settings during the COVID-19 Emergency Remote Teaching (ERT) provided a valuable opportunity to examine the use of educational technologies on a global scale with various digital readiness skills, beyond many past works that relied on small lab studies. Following a PRISMA-inspired methodology grounded on Moore’s three types of classroom interaction, this descriptive review investigates 22 empirical research papers published during the COVID-19 ERT era focused on higher-education online classrooms. We explore the empirical evidence reported in the collected corpus, and given how ERT remains a likely future occurrence, we suggest key directions for future research, including a new learning paradigm that centralizes and augments Learner-Content interaction to balance between flexibility and structure of online learning.</p> </div> <div class="bib hidden"> <pre style="font-size: 0.85em;"><code>@article{yarmand2025interactions,

Drawing on empirical research across education, behavioral science, and fleet management, this analysis identifies key dimensions of effective commercial driver coaching, highlights significant limitations of current practices, and outlines strategic recommendations focused explicitly on differentiation and optimization. The findings emphasize the superior effectiveness of personalized, manager-led coaching methods, yet also show how manager-led coaching alone is challenging to implement at scale given the scarce availability of expert coaches. On the other hand, this report shows that in-cabin automated warning systems and self-coaching offer strengths in scalability and flexible learning. However, without integration with more personalized and interactive feedback, these approaches alone do not achieve the same long-term safety outcomes as when combined with human-led coaching elements. As such, this report recommends a mix of the three approaches for future optimization, especially focusing on (1) strategic integration of AI-driven platforms, and (2) complementing existing risk identification coaching programs with targeted positive reinforcement mechanisms and regular short-session, in-person coaching. Ultimately, the provided evidence-based recommendations offer a potential pathway for achieving measurable improvements in driver safety outcomes, operational efficiency, and competitive differentiation.</p> </div> <div class="bib hidden"> <pre style="font-size: 0.85em;"><code>@article{weibel2025evaluating,

Using a mixed-methods field study, we compare hybrid and remote meeting configurations to better understand how to improve the inclusiveness and effectiveness of these different meeting modalities. Our findings indicate that overall, fully-remote meetings are the most inclusive and effective. Fully-remote meetings are perceived as more inclusive of remote attendees despite their lower chat usage compared to hybrid meetings. We also find that people’s preferred format varies depending on the purpose or type of meeting and the skill set of the meeting moderator. We provide recommendations for improving meeting inclusion and effectiveness in both hybrid and remote meetings, such as training moderators and integrating chats with the main meeting.</p> </div> <div class="bib hidden"> <pre style="font-size: 0.85em;"><code>@article{yarmand2024format,

We explore contouring, a critical workflow aimed at identifying and segmenting tumors, usually performed on immobile desktop computers in clinics, in which limited support for mobile access leads to prolonged and subpar treatment planning. Following interviews and think-aloud studies (N = 10 physicians), we report key contouring behaviors, and later design a novel cross-device prototype that enables contouring on everyday touch devices. We compared contouring via desktop and touch in a lab study (N = 8 residents) and found that mobile phones not only yielded similar accuracy, but also took significantly less time. Our results point to three broad design guidelines for cross-device solutions deployed within standalone healthcare workflows, and highlight how incorporating different device and input modalities can improve treatment delivery in today’s distributed healthcare environments.</p> </div> <div class="bib hidden"> <pre style="font-size: 0.85em;"><code>@inproceedings{yarmand2024enhancing,

Interviews and design-thinking workshops (N = four faculty; six residents) revealed misalignment between teaching methods and residents who desired timely, relevant, and diverse feedback. We further discuss reasons: overlapping learning content and strategies to ease tensions between clinical and teaching duties, and lack of support for exchange of cognitive processes. The follow-up survey study (N = 67 practitioners from 31 countries), which contained annotation and sketching tasks, provided diverse perspective over effective feedback elements. We lastly present sociotechnical implications in supporting faculty’s teaching duties and learners’ cognitive models, such as systematically leveraging senior learners in providing case-based guidance and supporting double-sided flow of cognitive information via in-situ video snippets.</p> </div> <div class="bib hidden"> <pre style="font-size: 0.85em;"><code>@inproceedings{yarmand2024d,

This work explores three learning platforms during a six-week field study at a college class (N=30 students): video conferencing system, video chat with 2D map, and Desktop VR with 3D map. Post-study interviews and survey results revealed that students strongly preferred the plain video conferencing system for lectures due to superior student-content interactions. Meanwhile, they indicated a higher sense of co-presence and social awareness via top-down viewing in 2D map, shape-changing and moving avatars, and spatial audio. This study suggests tailoring features to optimize one type of interaction informed by characteristics of the learning activities.</p> </div> <div class="bib hidden"> <pre style="font-size: 0.85em;"><code>@article{yarmand2024evaluating,

Current learning practices heavily rely on 2D atlases and practice on peers, which are notably less intuitive and pose risks, particularly in sensitive areas such as the eyes. To address these challenges, we introduce AcuVR, a Virtual Reality (VR) based system designed to add a layer of interactivity and realism. This innovation aims to reduce the risks associated with practicing acupuncture techniques while offering more effective learning strategies. Furthermore, AcuVR incorporates medical imaging and standardized anatomy models, enabling the simulation of customized acupuncture scenarios. This feature represents a significant advancement beyond the limitations of conventional resources such as atlases and textbooks, facilitating a more immersive and personalized learning experience. The evaluation study with eight acupuncture students and practitioners revealed high participant satisfaction and pointed to the effectiveness and potential of AcuVR as a valuable addition to acupuncture training.</p> </div> <div class="bib hidden"> <pre style="font-size: 0.85em;"><code>@article{zhang2024acuvr,

The process of acquiring such knowledge and using it for practical treatment is challenging due to the need for a deep understanding of human anatomy and the ability to apply both TCM and EBM approaches. Visual aids have been introduced to aid in understanding the alignment of acupuncture points with key elements of the human body, and are indispensable tools for both learners and expert acupuncturists. However, they are often not enough to enable effective practice and fail to fully support the learning process. Novel approaches based on immersive visualization and Virtual Reality (VR) have shown promise in many healthcare settings due to their unique advantages in terms of realism and interactions, but it is still unknown whether and how VR can possibly be beneficial to acupuncture training and treatment. Following participatory design protocols such as observations and semi-structured interviews with eight doctors and nine students, we explore the needs and pain points of current acupuncture workflows at the intersection of EBM and TCM in China and the United States. We highlight opportunities for introducing VR in today’s acupuncture training and treatment workflows, and discuss two design approaches that build on 11 specific challenges spanning education, diagnosis, treatment, and communication.</p> </div> <div class="bib hidden"> <pre style="font-size: 0.85em;"><code>@article{zhang2023vr,

Instead of creating new interaction techniques, we investigated how task geometric shapes and input modalities affect precision-first drawing performance in a within-subject study (n=12) focusing on 3D target tracing in commercially available VR headsets. We found that compared to using bare hands, VR controllers and pens yield nearly 30% of precision gain, and that the tasks with large curvature, forward-backward or left-right orientations perform best. We finally discuss opportunities for designing novel interaction techniques for precise 3D drawing.

However, today’s contouring software is constrained to only work with a 2D display, which is less intuitive and requires high task loads. Virtual Reality (VR) has shown great potential in various specialties of healthcare and health sciences education due to the unique advantages of intuitive and natural interactions in immersive spaces. VR-based radiation oncology integration has also been advocated as a target healthcare application, allowing providers to directly interact with 3D medical structures. We present VRContour and investigate how to effectively bring contouring for radiation oncology into VR. Through an autobiographical iterative design, we defined three design spaces focused on contouring in VR with the support of a tracked tablet and VR stylus, and investigating dimensionality for information consumption and input (either 2D or 2D + 3D). Through a within-subject study (n = 8), we found that visualizations of 3D medical structures significantly increase precision, and reduce mental load, frustration, as well as overall contouring effort. Participants also agreed with the benefits of using such metaphors for learning purposes.</p> </div> <div class="bib hidden"> <pre style="font-size: 0.85em;"><code>@inproceedings{chen2022vrcontour,

Today’s contouring software requires oncologists to inspect and contour target of interests by analyzing a stack of planar medical images, which is lengthy, tedious and sometimes error prone. Such design is also in contrast to the stereoscopic nature of medical images. Therefore, it is intuitive to consider bringing contouring into immersive Virtual Reality (VR) space. We present an exploratory study that uses iterative design to understand needs and opportunities to bring contour delineation into an immersive 3D space, such as the one enabled by today’s head-mounted VR displays. We report on the interactions with three medical professionals and three engineering &amp; design experts, and demonstrate the potential for VR–based 3D contouring while studying the benefits of using 3D immersive spaces to augment the process of contour in 2D. Through needs–finding interviews and co–design workshops, we evaluated our initial iterations and proof–of–concept prototypes. We believe that our preliminary findings will benefit researchers and practitioners who are attempting to bring today’s contour delineation processes into an immersive 3D space.</p> </div> <div class="bib hidden"> <pre style="font-size: 0.85em;"><code>@inproceedings{chen2022exploring,

Instructor interviews (N = 7) revealed that most students preferred not to share videos and verbally participate. This hindered instructors’ ability to read their classrooms and make deeper connections with students. Survey results (N = 102) suggested that students felt a lacking sense of community in online vs. in-person lectures. Some students felt uncomfortable broadcasting their appearances to everyone in the class, and some were unaware of the benefits for instructors. Most students favored using the text chat to participate. Considering the needs of both instructors and students, we propose recommendations to mitigate the loss of classroom interactions by collecting and presenting less invasive social cues in an aggregated format, and incorporating opportunities for informal exchanges and individual control to spark peer bonding.</p> </div> <div class="bib hidden"> <pre style="font-size: 0.85em;"><code>@inproceedings{yarmand2021feels,

What if participation cannot occur in person? How can we conduct these workshops remotely? Based on guidelines of the Wallet project that provides a framework for in-person design thinking workshops, we present the first experiences of facilitating 2 remote design workshops with radiation oncology faculty and residents. We report the logistics and tool support decisions for the first workshop, evaluate and adjust our approach for the second workshop, and present the 3 lessons learned: incorporating schedule flexibility, prioritizing technology familiarity, and integrating communication channels.</p> </div> <div class="bib hidden"> <pre style="font-size: 0.85em;"><code>@inproceedings{yarmand2021facilitating,

These video comments can resolve many points of confusion for learners. However, finding relevant content in a separated discussion forum is challenging and disruptive to learning flow. This paper introduces Adjacent Display of Relevant Discussion (ADRD): it displays threaded comments in a panel adjacent to the video and dynamically updates the content of the panel based on the time of the video. In a between-subjects lab study (n=20), ADRD helped participants resolve confusion points, skim and read comments, and encouraged video interaction.</p> </div> <div class="bib hidden"> <pre style="font-size: 0.85em;"><code>@inproceedings{yarmand2021adjacent,

To contextualize comments, people often reference specific audio/visual content within video. However, the literature falls short of explaining the types of video content people refer to, how they establish references and identify referents, how video characteristics (e.g., genre) impact referencing behaviors, and how references impact social engagement. We present a taxonomy for classifying video references by referent type and temporal specificity. Using our taxonomy, we analyzed 2.5K references with quotations and timestamps collected from public YouTube comments. We found: 1) people reference intervals of video more frequently than time-points, 2) visual entities are referenced more often than sounds, and 3) comments with quotes are more likely to receive replies but not more "likes". We discuss the need for in-situ dereferencing user interfaces, illustrate design concepts for typed referencing features, and provide a dataset for future studies.</p> </div> <div class="bib hidden"> <pre style="font-size: 0.85em;"><code>@inproceedings{yarmand2019can,
